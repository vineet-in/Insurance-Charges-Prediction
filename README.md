# Insurance-Charges-Prediction


This project aims to predict **medical insurance charges** based on a variety of features, such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, using machine learning models. We explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple regression techniques to build an accurate prediction model.

## Key Steps:
- Data analysis and visualization to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Preprocessing including one-hot encoding of categorical variables and log transformation for skewed data.
- Model building using Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso regression.
- Model evaluation using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
